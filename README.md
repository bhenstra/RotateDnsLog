# RotateDnsLog
Rotate Windows Server DNS Log

Batch file to rotate Window DNS logs. 

      Credits:

      This batch file is based on MoonPoint's batch file. 
      
      The original batch file is located at: 
      http://support.moonpoint.com/downloads/computer_languages/mswin_batch/rotatednslog.bat
      
      Please see the blog post at:

This a complete rewrite to suit my needs (eg compression of rotated logs). 
I am hoping this is helpful. Usage is at the user's own personal risk.
